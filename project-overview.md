# 🐳 Deploying Containerized Applications Using Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate

## No servers. Just containers.

Modern applications can be deployed and scaled without managing servers or EC2 instances.  
This project demonstrates how to deploy a containerized web application using **Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate**, where AWS automatically manages infrastructure, scaling, and availability.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Components

### 1. Amazon ECS Cluster
Provides a logical grouping for running containerized applications. The cluster acts as the foundation where ECS services and tasks are launched and monitored.

### 2. AWS Fargate
A serverless compute engine for containers that removes the need to provision or manage EC2 instances. Users define container requirements, and AWS handles infrastructure operations automatically.

### 3. Task Definition
Defines how a container runs, including the Docker image, CPU, memory allocation, networking mode, and runtime configuration.

### 4. Security Group
Acts as a network firewall for the containers, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to allow only authorized access, such as HTTP traffic from the internet.

## 🔄 Container Deployment Flow

1. An ECS cluster is created to host container workloads.  
2. A task definition specifies container image and resource requirements.  
3. An ECS service deploys and maintains the desired number of running tasks.  
4. A public IP is assigned, allowing the application to be accessed via a web browser.

## 💡 Why ECS with Fargate?

- No server or EC2 instance management  
- Automatic scaling and infrastructure handling  
- Pay-per-use pricing model  
- Built-in high availability and fault tolerance  
- Faster container deployment with minimal configuration
